# with one exception which is "merge coverage tests"
#
# a downside is that in the gitlab page, this makes many pipeline steps
# with similar names. We could change to abbreviated names (e.g.
# "coverage tests on " would be V, "container for " would be L, "checks"
# and "expensive checks" would be C and XC, and so on. But it would be
# really cryptic. to have, e.g. LC/debian10+gcc ; wouldn't it ?
